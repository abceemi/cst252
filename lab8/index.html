		<p>On this lab we where to work with our partner and experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="box">
		<h2> Problems</h2>
		<p> This lab started off strong. I received my code and followed the lab instructions. </br>
			It was then that I noticed there was a section that wasn't asked for. </br>
			I commented out that area and my output finally worked. I believe I was feeling overwhelmed with all the new information and included more things than necessary.
      </br>

	<div class="box">
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> I was able to successfully use functions and callbacks on my console. I was able to see my output.</p>
