//Create a function sortingHat()
//that takes a string as an argument: function sortingHat(str)
//counts the letters in str and assigns it to a variable len
//uses modulus (% operator) to get the remainder with 4: mod = len % 4;
//mod will now be a value between 0 and 3
//create a conditional that will return Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, and Hufflepuff depending on whether the value of mod is 0, 1, 2, or 3
//Create an event listener attached to #button
//that gets the value of #input and assigns it to a variable name
//runs sortingHat(name) and stores the result in a variable house
//appends a new styled paragraph to #output that says "The Sorting Hat has sorted you into " + house
