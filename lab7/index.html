		<h2> Challenges</h2>
		<p>In this lab we where to work with our partner in order to create functions that took user input and manipulate a string.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="box">
		<h2> Problems</h2>
		<p> This lab was really challenging. THe most difficult aspect was understanding how to set up each function.</br>
			My html wouldnâ€™t display the window to input the name. I later realized that I had to set the username = to the window.prompt.</br>
			I had to look back on my class notes to remember how to split and sort my arrays. </br>
			I feel that with more practice it will get easier.</p>

	<div class="box">
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p>I was able to create a unser name input and sort it. </p>
